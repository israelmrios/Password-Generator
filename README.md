# Password-Generator

## Description
This project was created to assist employees in creating a randomly generated password that meets the crieria of their choosing. This helps the employees cut down time spent choosing a strong password and prevents the same password being generated more than once.

I also created this project to demonstrate what I've learned to do with JavaScrip. It was extreamly exciting to ```console.log()``` a function or array and get the expected log. As well as motivating to see the error after it did not log what was expected and then working out the solution. The most interesting part of the project was learning at the end how all the functions, variables and objects have to connect in order for the code to work.
